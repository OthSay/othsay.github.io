title: "VisualWordGrid: Information Extraction From Scanned Documents Using A Multimodal Approach"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2024-02-17-paper-title-number-4
excerpt: 'We introduce a novel approach for scanned document representation to perform field extraction. It allows the simultaneous encoding of the textual, visual and layout information in a 3-axis tensor used as an input to a segmentation model. We improve the recent Chargrid and Wordgrid \cite{chargrid} models in several ways, first by taking into account the visual modality, then by boosting its robustness in regards to small datasets while keeping the inference time low. Our approach is tested on public and private document-image datasets, showing higher performances compared to the recent state-of-the-art methods.'
